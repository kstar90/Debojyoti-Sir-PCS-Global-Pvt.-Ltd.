    // Benefits of closure methods are as follows ->
    // 1) Encapsulation − The closure allows developers to hide or encapsulate the data. It makes data private and inaccessible from the global scope. So, you can expose only the required variables and functions and hide other internal details of the code.
    // 2) Preserving State − The function remembers its lexical scope even if the execution of the outer function is completed. So, developers can maintain the state as we were maintaining the state of the counter in the above examples.
    // 3) Improved memory efficiency − The closure allows you to manage memory efficiently, as you can only retain access to the necessary variables and do not need to define the variables globally.
